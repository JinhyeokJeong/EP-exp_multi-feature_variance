# Variability judgment tasks for multi-feature ensemble

These are example experiment scripts for variance estimation tasks of multi-feautre objects.

If you want to run this experiment, download all files including subdirectories in this repository, and then use one of three index files (```index_exp1.html```, ```index_exp2.html```, or ```index_exp3.html```) for running experiments.
This experiment was implemented using jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015; https://www.jspsych.org/) and used Spectrum plugin (https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum) to generate color stimuli.
